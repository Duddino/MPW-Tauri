#MPW Tauri

This is an experimental verison of MPW bundled by tauri.
It features a full wallet, complete with a PIVX node and backend explorer (WIP), as well as the usual light version.
Performance sensitive libraries, such as shield, will be compiled natively (WIP), which should make them considerably faster.
This may get merged in MPW when it becomes more stable.
